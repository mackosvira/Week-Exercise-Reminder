# Week-Exercise-Reminder

Bash shell script that creates weekly plan for exercises and open a reminder, e.g. at PC starup, to show completed/not completed exercises planned for the week.
Initially this script is planned to track, follow up, practise and exercises to keep in shape

The script is needed for practical reasons, but also for learning and bring in shape my already forgoten bash scripting knowledge.
